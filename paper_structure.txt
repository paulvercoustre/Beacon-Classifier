Paper structure

- Overview of project objectives, constraints, metrics

- Beacon technology, bluetooth signal

- Where I picked up the project:
    - signal processing analysis
    - results - This is the benchmark I have to beat

- Data exploration:
    - plots of label repartition, features,
    - dimensionality reduction: t-sne, PCA

- Base algorithm
    - Softmax Classifier on flattened data

- Model iterations:
    - Softmax Classifier with polynomial features
    - Random Forest, Gradient boosting
    - SVC
    - Neural Net on flattened data

- Shift paradigm
    We kill information by flattening the features,
    similar to flattening an image in Vision. Model is 3D

    To use recurrent models (temporal CNN, RNNs), we need more data:
    - Data augmentation

- Temporal models:
    - RNNs (SimpleRNN, GRU, LSTM)
    - 1D convNet

- Model Tuning:
    - FP vs FN
